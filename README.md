# Code-random-search-optimization-algorithm-of-PT

main.ipynb: You can run the algorithm and save the results.

bus_line.py and graph.py are the structure of PT.

environment.py, agent.py and runner.py form the random search optimization algorithm that we use.

ef_sig_no_yes.npy, sig_no_yes.npy and test_set.npy are the intermediate data obtained after the algorithm runs, which are used for the plotting.

box_plot.ipynb, features.ipynb, Graph_1_analysis.ipynb, index.ipynb: Analyze the results obtained by the algorithm and plot the images.
